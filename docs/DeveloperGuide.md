### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of TrackUp.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact.

**Main components of the architecture:**
- **`Main`** (consisting of [`Main`](src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) handles launching and shutting down the app.
- The app's core functionality is divided into:
    - [**`UI`**](#ui-component): Handles the user interface.
    - [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Executes commands.
    - [**`Model`**](#model-component): Manages in-memory data.
    - [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads and writes data to disk.
- [**`Commons`**](#common-classes) contains utility classes shared across components.

### **How Components Interact**
Below is a *Sequence Diagram* showing how TrackUp processes the command `delete 1`:

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each component:
- Defines its API through an `interface`.
- Implements functionality in `{Component Name}Manager` classes.

For example, `Logic` defines its API in `Logic.java` and implements it in `LogicManager.java`.

## **Component Breakdown**

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
- The `MainWindow` consists of several UI parts (e.g., `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`).
- Uses JavaFX, with UI layouts defined in `src/main/resources/view/*.fxml`.
- Interacts with:
    - **Logic** to execute commands.
    - **Model** to display data.


### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

ðŸ’¡ **How it works:**
1. A user enters a command.
2. `AddressBookParser` determines the appropriate `XYZCommandParser` (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`).
3. This creates a corresponding `XYZCommand` (e.g., `DeleteCommand`), executed by `LogicManager`.
4. The command modifies `Model` and returns a `CommandResult`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

- Stores all TrackUp data â€” specifically, Person objects contained within a UniquePersonList.
- Maintains a filtered list of currently displayed Person objects (for example, the result of a search query). This list is exposed as an unmodifiable ObservableList<Person>, which allows the UI to automatically update whenever the underlying data changes.
- Holds a UserPref object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed externally as a ReadOnlyUserPref object.
- Operates independently of the other three components. As the Model represents domain entities, it is designed to make sense on its own without depending on other components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
- Handles saving and loading both TrackUp data and user preferences in JSON format.
- Inherits from both AddressBookStorage and UserPrefStorage, allowing it to act as either depending on the functionality required.
- Depends on some classes from the Model component, as its role is to store and retrieve objects that belong to the Model.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## **Implementation Details**

### **Undo/Redo Feature (Proposed)**

- Implemented in `VersionedTrackUp`, extending `TrackUp`.
- Stores history as an `addressBookStateList` with a `currentStatePointer`.
- Supports:
    - `commit()` - Saves current state.
    - `undo()` - Restores previous state.
    - `redo()` - Reapplies undone state.

Workflow:

1. User executes `delete 5`, committing a new state.
2. Executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹`, committing another state.
3. Uses `undo`, restoring the previous state.
4. Uses `redo`, reapplying the undone state.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo operations are handled:**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Store snapshots of the entire address book state.
    * Pros: Straightforward and simple to implement.
    * Cons: Potential memory inefficiency due to storing large states repeatedly.

* **Alternative 2:** Each individual command maintains its own undo/redo logic.
    * Pros: More memory-efficient (for example, `delete` only stores the deleted contact).
    * Cons: Increases complexity â€” every command must correctly implement and manage undo/redo behavior.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Data Requirements**
1. Persistency: All user data, including contacts, events, and notes, must be stored locally in a human-editable text file.
2. Data Size: The application should efficiently handle up to 10,000 contacts and 50,000 event entries without noticeable performance degradation.
3. Data Volatility: Changes to data should be saved immediately upon execution of commands to prevent data loss.

**Environment Requirements**
1. Platform Independence: The application should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux without requiring platform-specific modifications.
2. Java Compatibility: The application must be compatible with Java 17 and should not require any additional dependencies beyond those included in the JAR package.
3. Portability: The application should function without an installation process and be packaged as a single executable JAR file.
4. Resolution Compatibility: The GUI (if present) should work seamlessly at 1920x1080 and 125% scaling and remain usable at 1280x720 and 150% scaling.

**Accessibility & Usability**
1. Typing-Optimised: The application must prioritise CLI-based input to cater to users who type fast, allowing all actions to be performed through text commands.
2. Minimal GUI Elements: If a GUI is implemented, it should primarily provide visual feedback rather than serve as the primary input method.
3. Learnability: The application should provide a quick-start tutorial that allows new users to become proficient within 10 minutes.
   
**Performance Requirements**
1. Response Time: Commands should execute within 500ms under normal operation (10,000 contacts, 50,000 event entries).
2. Memory Usage: The application should not exceed 200MB of RAM usage during peak operations.
3. Startup Time: The application should launch and be ready for use within 2 seconds on a modern system (Intel i5 8th Gen, 8GB RAM, SSD).

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.
