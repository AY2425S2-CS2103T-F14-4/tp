### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="500" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of TrackUp.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact.

**Main components of the architecture:**
- **`Main`** (consisting of [`Main`](src/main/java/trackup/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](src/main/java/trackup/MainApp.java)) handles launching and shutting down the app.
- The app's core functionality is divided into:
    - [**`UI`**](#ui-component): Handles the user interface.
    - [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Executes commands.
    - [**`Model`**](#model-component): Manages in-memory data.
    - [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads and writes data to disk.
- [**`Commons`**](#common-classes) contains utility classes shared across components.

**How Components Interact**  

Below is a *Sequence Diagram* showing how TrackUp processes the command `delete 1`:

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="700" />

Each component:
- Defines its API through an `interface`.
- Implements functionality in `{Component Name}Manager` classes.

For example, `Logic` defines its API in `Logic.java` and implements it in `LogicManager.java`.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="500" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackup/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram1.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/trackup/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
- The `MainWindow` consists of several UI parts (e.g., `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`).
- Uses JavaFX, with UI layouts defined in `src/main/resources/view/*.fxml`.
- Interacts with:
    - **Logic** to execute commands.
    - **Model** to display data.


### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/trackup/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

ðŸ’¡ **How it works:**
1. A user enters a command.
2. `AddressBookParser` determines the appropriate `XYZCommandParser` (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`).
3. This creates a corresponding `XYZCommand` (e.g., `DeleteCommand`), executed by `LogicManager`.
4. The command modifies `Model` and returns a `CommandResult`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

#### `AddCommandParser` Logic Enhancement
- The `AddCommandParser` validates required fields (name, phone, email, address) individually
  and throws descriptive error messages for each missing attribute.
- This improves user feedback and avoids a generic format error.

#### DeleteByCommand Logic
- The `DeleteByCommand` performs exact matching across multiple attributes.
- If no attributes are provided, an error is thrown.
- If multiple contacts match the criteria, a warning message is shown.
- If one match is found, the contact is deleted.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/trackup/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- Stores all TrackUp data, including:
  - Person objects contained within a UniquePersonList
  - Event objects contained within a UniqueEventList
- Maintains a filtered list of currently displayed Person objects and Event objects.
  - The filtered person list supports searching, listing by category, and sorting by multiple fields.
  - These lists are exposed as unmodifiable ObservableLists, allowing the UI to update automatically when data changes.
- Holds a UserPref object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed externally as a ReadOnlyUserPref object.
- Operates independently of the other three components. As the Model represents domain entities, it is designed to make sense on its own without depending on other components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

#### Class Diagram of DeleteByCommand and Related Model Interactions

The following diagram shows the relationship between `DeleteByCommand` and core model classes.

![DeleteByCommand Class Diagram](images/DeleteByCommandClassDiagram.png)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackup/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram1.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
- Handles saving and loading both TrackUp data and user preferences in JSON format.
- Inherits from both AddressBookStorage and UserPrefStorage, allowing it to act as either depending on the functionality required.
- Depends on some classes from the Model component, as its role is to store and retrieve objects that belong to the Model.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `trackup.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

- Implemented in `VersionedTrackUp`, extending `TrackUp`.
- Stores history as an `addressBookStateList` with a `currentStatePointer`.
- Supports:
    - `commit()` - Saves current state.
    - `undo()` - Restores previous state.
    - `redo()` - Reapplies undone state.

Workflow:

1. User executes `delete 5`, committing a new state.
2. Executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹`, committing another state.
3. Uses `undo`, restoring the previous state.
4. Uses `redo`, reapplying the undone state.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo operations are handled:**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Store snapshots of the entire address book state.
    * Pros: Straightforward and simple to implement.
    * Cons: Potential memory inefficiency due to storing large states repeatedly.

* **Alternative 2:** Each individual command maintains its own undo/redo logic.
    * Pros: More memory-efficient (for example, `delete` only stores the deleted contact).
    * Cons: Increases complexity â€” every command must correctly implement and manage undo/redo behavior.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

- We propose implementing data archiving by allowing the user to archive inactive contacts. Archived contacts
will not appear in the active contact list but will be stored separately for retrieval. The archived
data will be saved in a designated JSON file, archive.json, and displayed upon user request via an archive command.

       **Expected:** Error for unsupported field.

### Saving data

1. **Handling missing or corrupted data files**

    1. Delete or rename the `data/trackup.json` file while the application is closed.
        - **Expected:** When the app is launched again, it should recreate the file with default content without crashing.

    2. Modify the JSON file and introduce an invalid value (e.g., change a phone number to `"abc"`).
        - **Expected:** Upon startup, TrackUp will show an error dialog indicating corrupted data and load with an empty state.

    3. Save a contact or event and then restart the app.
        - **Expected:** The newly added data should persist across restarts.

---

## **Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 4

1. **Smart Contact Deletion Warnings**
    - *Current*: The app deletes a contact immediately when the delete or deleteby command is used, without checking relationships.
    - *Planned*: If a contact is linked to an event or mentioned in a note (e.g., "Amy Lee is lead for this meeting"), the app prompts the user for confirmation:
      `This contact is referenced in one or more events or notes. Are you sure you want to delete Amy Lee? (y/n)`
    - *Reason*: Prevents accidental loss of linked data and improves user awareness of contact associations.

2. **Edit Command Input Validation Enhancements**
    - *Current*: Accepts input with missing fields without clear feedback.
    - *Planned*: Explicitly alert users when all fields are missing in an edit command.
      For example: `No fields provided. Please specify at least one field to edit.`
    - *Reason* : Reduces user confusion and enforces proper command usage.

3. **Auto-Restore Contact List After Empty Search/Find**
   - *Current*: When the search or find command returns no matching persons, the UI shows an empty contact list. To view contacts again, users must manually run the list command. 
   - *Planned*: Automatically display a message such as `No matching persons found. Showing all contacts again.`
   and immediately restore the full contact list in the UI. 
   - *Reason*: Saves users from having to re-run the list command and improves flow when navigating back after a failed search.

4. **Accurate Feedback for Empty List Command with Category Results**
    - *Current*: When the list command is used with a category (e.g., list Other) and no contacts exist in that category, the app still displays the message: `Listed all persons in category: [Other]` even though the resulting list is empty.
    - *Planned*: Detect when no contacts are found and display a clearer message such as: `No contacts found in category: [Other]` to distinguish it from a successful filtered listing.
    - *Reason*: Prevents confusion and helps users understand that the category exists but currently has no matching contacts.

5. **Undo Support for Destructive Commands**
    - *Current*: Commands like clear, delete, delevent, or delnote cannot be reversed. 
    - *Planned*: Introduce a basic undo feature that allows reverting the most recent destructive command. 
    - *Reason*: Offers a safety net for mistakes and enhances user trust.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Data Requirements**
1. Persistency: All user data, including contacts, events, and notes, must be stored locally in a human-editable text file.
2. Data Size: The application should efficiently handle up to 10,000 contacts and 50,000 event entries without noticeable performance degradation.
3. Data Volatility: Changes to data should be saved immediately upon execution of commands to prevent data loss.

**Environment Requirements**
1. Platform Independence: The application should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux without requiring platform-specific modifications.
2. Java Compatibility: The application must be compatible with Java 17 and should not require any additional dependencies beyond those included in the JAR package.
3. Portability: The application should function without an installation process and be packaged as a single executable JAR file.
4. Resolution Compatibility: The GUI (if present) should work seamlessly at 1920x1080 and 125% scaling and remain usable at 1280x720 and 150% scaling.

**Accessibility & Usability**
1. Typing-Optimised: The application must prioritise CLI-based input to cater to users who type fast, allowing all actions to be performed through text commands.
2. Minimal GUI Elements: If a GUI is implemented, it should primarily provide visual feedback rather than serve as the primary input method.
3. Learnability: The application should provide a quick-start tutorial that allows new users to become proficient within 10 minutes.

**Performance Requirements**
1. Response Time: Commands should execute within 500ms under normal operation (10,000 contacts, 50,000 event entries).
2. Memory Usage: The application should not exceed 200MB of RAM usage during peak operations.
3. Startup Time: The application should launch and be ready for use within 2 seconds on a modern system (Intel i5 8th Gen, 8GB RAM, SSD).

**Security & Privacy**
1. Data Confidentiality: User data must remain local and should not be transmitted over the internet.
2. No External Storage: The application should not rely on remote servers for storage or functionality.
3. User Control: Users should have complete control over their data, with the ability to edit, back up, and delete it manually.

**Maintainability & Extensibility**
1. Modular Codebase: The system should follow Object-Oriented Programming principles to facilitate maintainability.
2. Incremental Development: Features should be added in small, working increments to ensure continuous functionality.
3. Extensibility: New features should be implementable without breaking existing functionality, following Open/Closed Principle (OCP).

**Reliability & Fault Tolerance**
1. Error Handling: The application should provide meaningful error messages for invalid user input.
2. Fault Recovery: The application should automatically recover from crashes by restoring the last saved state.
3. Data Integrity: Data should not be corrupted even in the event of an unexpected shutdown.
4. Informative Deletion Errors: When deletion fails due to dependencies (e.g., linked events), the app should indicate which contact or event is causing the block.

**Testability**
1. Automated Testing: The application should support unit and integration testing to ensure correctness.
2. Manual Testing Feasibility: The application should be testable by peer testers without requiring complex setups.
3. Regression Prevention: Existing functionalities should remain functional after new feature additions.

**Scalability & Stability**
1. Scalability: The application should handle an increasing number of contacts and events without performance degradation.
2. Stability: The application should function without crashes or major bugs under normal operating conditions.
