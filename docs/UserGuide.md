## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` indicate the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g., in `add -n <NAME>`, `<NAME>` is a parameter which can be used as `add -n "John Doe"`.
- Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g., `-c <CATEGORY>` is optional.
- The order of parameters is flexible.
  e.g., `add -n "John Doe" -p 98765432` is equivalent to `add -p 98765432 -n "John Doe"`.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not require any (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`) will be ignored.
- When copying commands from this PDF version, ensure that line breaks do not remove necessary spaces.

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds and lists all contacts in TrackUp whose names contain any of the specified keywords. Keyword matching is performed in a case-insensitive manner, and the search is based solely on the names of contacts.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

**Details:**
- The search is **case-insensitive**. For example, `hans` will match `Hans`.
- The order of keywords does not matter. For example, `Hans Bo` will match contacts with names like `Bo Hans`.
- Only the **name** attribute is searched.
- Only **full word** matches are considered. For instance, searching for `Han` will not match a name containing `Hans`.
- The command returns contacts that match **at least one** of the keywords (i.e., an OR search).

**Examples:**
- `find John` may return contacts such as `John Doe`.
- `find alex david` may return contacts like `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li`.

- `<INDEX>` refers to the contact's index in the current list (must be a positive integer).

**Examples:**
- `delete 3` — deletes the third contact in the current list.
- `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.

### Deleting a person by attributes: `deleteby`

Deletes a contact from TrackUp using one or more attributes.

**Notes:**
- Deletes the person that matches the provided attributes.
- At least one attribute must be specified.
- Attribute matching is exact and case-sensitive.

**Examples:**

- `deleteby -n John Doe -p 98765432` deletes the person named **John Doe** with phone number **98765432**.

### Searching for a person: `search`

## Saving and Editing Data

- **Saving the Data:**
  TrackUp automatically saves data as a JSON file in your home folder after any command that changes the data.

- **Editing the Data File:**
  The data is stored as a JSON file (e.g., `[JAR file location]/data/trackup.json`). Advanced users can edit this file directly, but be sure to back up the file first.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Editing the data file incorrectly may cause TrackUp to discard all data or behave unexpectedly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install TrackUp on the other computer and replace the empty data file it creates with your backup from your previous TrackUp home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Issues

1. **Multi-screen Usage:**
   When using multiple screens, if you move the application between screens, the GUI might open off-screen on some setups. Delete the `preferences.json` file in your TrackUp folder to reset the display settings.

2. **Help Window Behavior:**
   If you minimize the Help Window and then issue the `help` command again, the original Help Window may remain minimized. Manually restore the window to view the help message.
